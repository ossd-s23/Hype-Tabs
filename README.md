# Hype Tabs

Say "no more" to boring tabs. Hype-Tabs is Firefox add-on that will change the color of your active tab, making switching between tabs an exhilerating experience. Take the fun to another level by clicking the extension icon and Hyping up your Tabs (it changes the title and icons of all your tabs).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the about:debugging page in Firefox and select "This Firefox" from the left-hand menu.
3. Under "Temporary Extensions", click the "Load Temporary Add-on" button and select any file from your local clone of Hype Tabs.
4. Try it out! Hype Tabs should now be active until you restart Firefox.
